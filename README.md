# 🎶 Eurovision Score 2016 - 2024 Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores voting patterns, jury vs televote dynamics, and statistical relationships in the **Eurovision Song Contest**. Using real historical datasets, I performed **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, regression models, clustering, and dimensionality reduction** to uncover hidden insights about how countries vote and what factors may influence the outcomes.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze jury and televote scores for Eurovision finalists.
* Identify trends and biases in voting across years and countries.
* Apply statistical models (regression, hypothesis testing) to study voting behavior.
* Use unsupervised learning (clustering, t-SNE, MDS) to detect groups of countries with similar voting patterns.
* Build clear and interactive visualizations to tell a data-driven story.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

* **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2, caret, cluster, stats)
* **Data Visualization:** ggplot2, plotly, ggpairs
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** MDS, t-SNE
* **Clustering:** K-means
* **Statistical Analysis:** Regression, t-tests, correlations

---

## 📊 Key Results

* 📌 **Jury vs Televote:** Televote scores often diverge from jury scores, and televote tends to better predict the overall ranking.
* 📌 **Regression Analysis:** Positive correlation between televote and final score, weaker correlation for jury votes.
* 📌 **Clustering & t-SNE:** Clear groups of countries with similar voting behaviors, helping to explain recurring voting alliances.

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Build an **interactive dashboard** with **Shiny** to allow users to explore votes by year and country.
* Include **NLP analysis of lyrics** to see if sentiment or topic influences scores.
* Apply **predictive models** (Random Forest, XGBoost) to estimate the probability of a country reaching the Top 10.
